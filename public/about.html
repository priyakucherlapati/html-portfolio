<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>👋 Hi there! I’m Priya Kucherlapati, a passionate computer science student based in United States.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My journey in the world of technology began when I wrote my first “Hello, World!” program.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, I’ve been on an exciting quest to explore the realms of software development.

  <br>
  🌐 Web Technologies: From HTML and CSS to JavaScript frameworks like React and Node.js, I’m fascinated by the ever-evolving web ecosystem.
  <br>
  🔍 Problem-Solving: Debugging code, untangling complex algorithms, and finding elegant solutions—it’s like solving puzzles that make the digital world tick.
